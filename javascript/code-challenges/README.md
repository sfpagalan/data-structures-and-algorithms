## Whiteboard Process

## Approach & Efficiency

- Approach: The approach taken is an iterative one, which reverses an array by creating a new array and adding elements from the input array in reverse order.

- Why: This approach was chosen because it adheres to the challenge requirement of not using built-in methods and is straightforward to implement.

- Big O Time Complexity: The time complexity is O(n) because it iterates through the input array once, performing a constant-time operation for each element.

- Big O Space Complexity: The space complexity is also O(n) because it creates a new array to store the reversed elements, with space proportional to the size of the input array.
